Our current SECO regression testing process is manual and requires significant effort to connect to multiple components, such as SQL Server databases, Linux servers, and Kafka topics. The sequential nature of the process leads to delays, tester conflicts, and a growing list of errors. Test case creation, execution, result collection, and reporting demand considerable manual intervention, reducing both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the absence of parallel execution and automated scaling further slows down the process.

To overcome these challenges, we are building an automated regression testing framework using Apache Camel, Java, and Spring Boot. The solution will seamlessly integrate with external components like SQL Server, Kafka, and Linux servers through Apache Camelâ€™s built-in connectors. It will feature a rich UI supporting both prepopulated and custom test cases. The framework will offer real-time monitoring, log generation, and parallel execution to minimize delays. Furthermore, it will auto-scale to efficiently manage multiple test cases, ensuring faster execution, conflict-free operations, and improved accuracy.
